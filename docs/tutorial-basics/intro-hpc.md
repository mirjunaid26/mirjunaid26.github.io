# What is High-Performance Computing (HPC)s

HPC is technology that uses clusters of powerful processors, working in parallel, to process massive multi-dimensional datasets (big data) and solve complex problems at extremely high speeds. HPC systems typically perform at speeds more than one million times faster than the fastest commodity desktop, laptop or server systems.

For decades the HPC system paradigm was the supercomputer, a purpose-built computer that embodies millions of processors or processor cores. Supercomputers are still with us; at this writing, the fastest supercomputer is the US-based Frontier, with a processing speed of 1.102 exaflops, or quintillion floating point operations per second (flops). But today, more and more organizations are running HPC solutions on clusters of high-speed computers servers, hosted on premises or in the cloud.

HPC workloads uncover important new insights that advance human knowledge and create significant competitive advantage. For example, HPC is used to sequence DNA, automate stock trading, and run artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and simulations—like those enabling self-driving automobiles—that analyze terabytes of data streaming from IoT sensors, radar and GPS systems in real time to make split-second decisions.

# How does HPC work?

A standard computing system solves problems primarily using serial computing—it divides the workload into a sequence of tasks, and then executes the tasks one after the other on the same processor.

In contrast, HPC leverages

Massively parallel computing. Parallel computing runs multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple computer servers or processors. Massively parallel computing is parallel computing using tens of thousands to millions of processors or processor cores.

Computer clusters (also called HPC clusters). An HPC cluster consists of multiple high-speed computer servers networked together, with a centralized scheduler that manages the parallel computing workload. The computers, called nodes, use either high-performance multi-core CPUs or, more likely today, GPUs (graphical processing units), which are well suited for rigorous mathematical calculations, machine learning models and graphics-intensive tasks. A single HPC cluster can include 100,000 or more nodes.

High-performance components: All the other computing resources in an HPC cluster—networking, memory, storage and file systems—are high-speed, high-throughput and low-latency components that can keep pace with the nodes and optimize the computing power and performance of the cluster.

## Key Features and Benefits of HPC

1. **Speed and Scalability:** HPC systems are designed to deliver exceptional processing speed and scalability. By distributing computational tasks across multiple processors or computing nodes, HPC allows for parallel execution, significantly reducing the time required to complete computationally demanding tasks.

2. **Large-Scale Data Processing:** HPC facilitates the processing and analysis of massive datasets by leveraging parallel computing techniques. It enables researchers and scientists to tackle data-intensive challenges, such as genomics, climate modeling, financial analysis, and big data analytics, with improved efficiency.

3. **Complex Simulations and Modeling:** HPC empowers researchers to perform complex simulations and modeling tasks that require extensive computational resources. It enables the exploration of intricate physical phenomena, optimization of designs, and prediction of system behavior by dividing the workload among multiple processors and solving parts of the problem simultaneously.

4. **Scientific Discovery and Innovation:** HPC plays a vital role in accelerating scientific discovery and fostering innovation. It enables researchers to tackle complex problems, conduct advanced simulations, and analyze large-scale datasets, leading to breakthroughs in diverse fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and astronomy.

5. **Parallel Algorithms and Software:** HPC systems require the development and implementation of parallel algorithms and software to fully exploit their capabilities. Parallel programming languages, frameworks, and libraries enable programmers to efficiently distribute tasks across processors and manage communication and synchronization between them.
